# Conformance Investigation Folder

This folder contains all documentation, tools, and knowledge accumulated during the investigation and fixing of Oxc formatter conformance test regressions.

## Purpose

The `temp/resume-fixing-conformance-tests` branch contains a major refactoring that removed `AstKind::Argument` from the AST, causing numerous formatter regressions. This folder helps track:

1. What has been fixed
2. What still needs fixing
3. How to approach remaining issues
4. Tools to analyze and prioritize work

## Quick Start

```bash
# Analyze current test failures
python3 conformance_investigation_scripts.py

# Check detailed fix guide
cat CONFORMANCE_FIX_GUIDE.md

# Review accumulated knowledge
cat CLAUDE.md
```

## For New Contributors

**‚ö†Ô∏è New to this investigation? Start with START_HERE.md for complete context!**

1. Read **START_HERE.md** first if you have no context
2. Use the Python scripts to analyze current failures
3. Follow **ACTION_PLAN.md** for prioritized fixes
4. Reference **CONFORMANCE_FIX_GUIDE.md** for implementation details
5. Check **GLOSSARY.md** when you encounter unfamiliar terms

## Key Insight

All regressions stem from removing `AstKind::Argument` from the AST. Most fixes involve:

- Detecting when expressions are used as arguments without the AST node
- Special-casing test framework patterns
- Fixing comment attachment points
