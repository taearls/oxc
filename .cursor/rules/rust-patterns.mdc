# Rust Refactoring Patterns

## Extract Helper Functions
When you see complex nested logic, extract it into focused helper functions.

## Use Guard Clauses
Replace nested conditions with early returns for cleaner code flow.

## Consolidate Pattern Matching
Replace repetitive match arms with helper functions that handle common patterns.

## Type-Safe Enums
Use enums instead of runtime string/type checking for better safety.
