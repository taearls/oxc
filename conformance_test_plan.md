# Conformance Test Regression Plan

## Overview
I am working on a dev branch that has introduced regressions after removing AstKind::Argument from the AstKind enum that is generated by `cargo run -p ast_tools`.

My pull request can be found at https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/pull/12525.

## Step by Step Analysis
1. run `cargo run -p oxc_prettier_conformance` in main after regenerating the AST. write the total amount of passing tests for JavaScript and TypeScript to a markdown file called REMAINING_CONFORMANCE_TEST_ANALYSIS.md. Also list the name of each passing test. Put this information under a heading called `main branch analysis`
2. switch back to this branch, 'temp/fix-conformance-tests-take-two' and run `cargo run -p oxc_prettier_conformance` again after regenerating the AST. Again, write the total amount of passing tests and the name of each passing test into REMAINING_CONFORMANCE_TEST_ANALYSIS.md. This time, put this information under a heading called `dev branch analysis` 
3. Scan the REMAINING_CONFORMANCE_TEST_ANALYSIS.md. Compare the tests that are passing in the main branch versus the ones that are passing in the dev branch. List each test that is not passing in the dev branch but passing in main under a new heading called `remaining tests to address`.
4. Formulate an action plan to address the remaining tests, in order of simplest to most complex.

## Implementation Guidelines

- Prefer simplicity as much as possible.
- Do not write loop literals or while loops.
- Leverage existing utility functions as much as possible rather than writing new code.
- If needed, add debugging output to assist in investigating the root causes of the test regressions.
